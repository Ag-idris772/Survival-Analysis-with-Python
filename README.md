# Understanding Customer Churn using Survival Analysis (Kaplan Meier Curve & Cox Proportional Hazards)

In today's discussion we will be making use of microsoft's adventureworks 2022 database (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16) 
to predict how long it takes for customers to churn and what exactly is responsible for this churn. 
We will also be making use of an imaginary company which sells primarily 3 types of products namely accessories, bikes and clothes.

# Datasets
The datasets used in this project were queired in from the AdventureWorks2022 database which is stored in sql. The link has been provided above. A zipped file was also included containing 
the datasets used for the kmf & cph models used after preprocessing had been carried out. Feel free to use these datasets and jump straight into creating the plots.
